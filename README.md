====================

My name is James Snider and I have been designing, building, and integrating applications to increase business efficiency for the past three years utilizing various programming languages.  Those languages include JAVA, Javascript, C#, .NET, XML, and HTML on both Windows and Linux platforms.  I pride myself on being an extremely fast learner and value learning new tools and techniques to further my skillset.  Please see the below links for samples of some of my past/current work.
